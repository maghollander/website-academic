I am committed to conducting health services and health policy research that improves the health and health care of vulnerable populations with mental health and substance use disorders. To that end, my research focuses on: 1) how the policy and financing of mental health and substance use treatment impacts its quality, use, and outcomes; and 2) how policy and evidence can mitigate disparities in mental health and substance use disorder treatment driven by institutional and interpersonal racism.

I earned my PhD in Health Services Research and Policy from the University of Pittsburgh in 2020 and completed a postdoctoral fellowship in Mental Health Services and Systems at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in 2022.
